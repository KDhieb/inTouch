# inTouch - TreeHacks 2021 Submission
## A social media proof of concept made to take the hassle out of keeping in touch.

## How we built it

inTouch is built with a serverless architecture using React. Our application authentication is handled using Google's Firebase identity and authentication APIs. Our database is hosted on Firebase realtime database, and we have a separate node.js API server for calculating optimal touchablesâ„¢. When such an event is found, we use Google calendar APIs in order to create a meeting and invite the other participants.

## Is the site live?
Not yet. Currently, our app is only authorized to access Google Calendar data from registered testers and admin. However, you are free to use the code yourself while using your own personal API keys (From Firebase and Google). Just make sure to properly set them up as environment variables.
